     Between my fingers and my thumb
     It rests so quiet and never dumb
     Sliding and gliding on the open page
     It keeps me busy in my bookish page.

     Its life flows from its fountain of ink
     With which it makes the longest link.
     It pricks and probes with its nifty nibs
     Its shiny tooth, its eloquent teeth.
     
     Digging and daring from the days of old.
     An ancient tool forever bold.
     A world or words from its fluent tongue.
     The magic of music, the endless song.

     In its inky fountain there's a glowing fire.
     We stoke it deep and it takes us higher.
     Silent warrior with the thunderous word.
     Forever mightier than the mightiest sword.

     - Niyi Osundare
